This is all my assignments from introduction to computer science - python. Most of it is very basic - how to write a function,
how to write pre and post conditions, baisc math functions, how to do loops, etc.

While simple, it is a nice reminder of my first computer science class as well as a great reference to teach/learn computer 
science (along with my professor's textbook at http://www2.ncssm.edu/~morrison/froobles/newPy/).
